## Overview

### Screenshot

![qr-code component screenshot](./images/qr-project-screenshot.png)

This is the first project of many that I intend on creating from the frontendmentor learning path. This project involved the creation of a qr-code component and this has been done utilising html and CSS. This is the screenshot of the final qr-code component product.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic and non-semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

For my continued development, I would like to get more comfortable with the flex declarations, specifically the flex-basis declaration as I seem to struggle to understand how flex-basis affects the overall style of the webpage.

I shall continue studying and practicing this aspect of CSS.
